Collection and Usage of Data, Data Sharing and Deletion of Data
---

eggtrainer.com collects identifying user information including but not limited to email addresses, usernames and password hashes provided by it's users. This identifying data will not be shared with any third party unless compelled by law. This information can be deleted at any time via the "Privacy" page, with a 48 hour delay; if you change your mind about deleting your account, you may simply log back in to cancel the deletion countdown. Some non-identifying parts of your in-game data may survive this deletion, but will be inaccessible to users. Emails provided to eggtrainer.com may occasionally be used to communicate with users directly for security, promotional and troubleshooting purposes.

Financial information that the user chooses to share with PayPal via eggtrainer.com's in-game purchases will not be stored. Purchase history will be stored to ensure the integrity of gameplay (i.e. ensuring each user gets the items they purchased). This data will not be deleted and cannot be deleted by users.

Anonymous information will be collected in aggregate including but not limited to user play session length, number of users and rough locations of IP addresses (at a country level) via Google analytics tools, and as such will be shared with Google analytics. This data will not be deleted and cannot be deleted by users.
