I'm looking for an artist to help create base images and cosmetics for the creatures, as well as designing some of the creatures.

I've been working on this game almost non-stop since the beginning of the year, and it's getting close to having a working battle system - once the battle system and cosmetics are finished, I'll be opening the game up for beta players. If you want a code to login, please feel free to email me (I can also upgrade your account if you've already signed up).

It already has a premium shop, and I've made a little bit of money so far. I'm willing to go halves in the premium shop for as long as we're working together.

If you're interested, please contact me at [krgamestudios@gmail.com](mailto:krgamestudios@gmail.com).

Raise, train and battle creatures from eggs!

Inspired by popular monster battling games, Egg Trainer allows you to buy eggs from the market, hatch them, then train them - each one is different, and even creatures within the same species can vary wildly in strengths.

Once you've trained a set of six powerful creatures, you can battle them against other players in real time!

Your creatures fight in pairs, with each creature having a choice of four different actions. Some actions will gain benefits or drawbacks depending on the elemental type of your creature, the move, and the opponent's creature.

You can also breed creatures to produce new eggs, some of which are extremely rare.

What will you hatch next?
