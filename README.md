# Egg Trainer

Raise, train and battle monsters from eggs!

Inspired by popular monster battling games, Egg Trainer allows you to buy eggs from the monster market, hatch them, then train them - each one is different, and even monsters within the same species can vary wildly in strengths.

Once you've trained a set of six powerful monsters, you can battle them against other players in real time!

Your monsters fight in pairs, with each monster having a choice of four different actions. Some actions will gain benefits or drawbacks depending on the elemental type of your monster, the move, and the opponent's monster.

You can also breed monsters to produce new eggs, some of which are extremely rare.

What will you hatch next?
