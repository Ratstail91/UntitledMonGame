That's a lovely backend you've got there...

_29 January 2020_

Today, for the first time since I started accepting alpha signups, there are no new features or visible changes for the players.

This was inevitable, you can't always keep the same pace of visible changes for changes sake. Instead, I spent today working on the back-end of the game i.e. I was rearranging code to make it easier to understand, and faster to develop in the long run.

I've also added an administration page, but players can't see that. It'll let me access in-game data without having to directly log in.

To tide you over, here's some amazing concept art done by yours truly:
