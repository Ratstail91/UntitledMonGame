Hot Swapping!
---

_23 February 2020_

Today, I got the creatures to swap between each other in battle! Use the "back" emoji buttons on the far left (or top on mobile) of the battle pane to take a creature out of battle - you can then select one of your other creatures to enter battle.

Remember to click the "submit" button under the log panel, otherwise none of this will take effect.

Also, you can currently do this as many times as you like - there's not turn limit just yet.

My god - the code is getting really ugly. Not just the display code either - some of the back-end code is becoming incredibly dense and hard to follow. This is a natural progression of any game, I'm just hoping it's not becoming too fragile. But that's what you alpha testers are here for - to (pardon the pun) battle test my code as hard as you can.
