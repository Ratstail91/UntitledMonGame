### Hello world!

_22 January 2020_

Egg Trainer is now open for business!

Sort of.

Signups and logins are working, as are privacy settings like controlling promotional emails and deleting your account. All the basic facilities are here, it's just lacking...

Gameplay.

Don't worry. This will change soon enough. For now though, regular accounts won't be able to log in, even though they will be created. The only exception to this are "alpha accounts", specially designated accounts for testing the website, held by a select few people. I plan to have no more than 50 of these created, but plans tend ot go astray, no?

If you wish to have your account upgraded to an alpha account, or you want access to an existing alpha code, feel free to contact me at krgamestudios@gmail.com.

In the meantime, please have patience, and don't count your eggs before they incubate.

Best regards,

Kayne Ruse, KR Game Studios
