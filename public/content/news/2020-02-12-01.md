Happy Anniversary!

_12 February 2020_

It's officially one month since I started working on this game, and holy cow have I come a long way!

Today, I did some styling on the battle boxes, and added the ability to lock them.

However, I've also added the ability to train your creatures! Hover over "Training" in a creature's action menu, and the options for training will become visible. I won't add anything like a whip or a hoop as a requirement for training them, even though I'd thought about it... but I think it's better to allow it by default.

As you train, you'll notice that it takes longer and longer to train the creatures. It'll take a total of 137 minutes to train a single creature entirely, not including the downtime; there's a total of 16 training points to be allocated. Also, you can only train one creature at a time.

We're really making progress - this game is something to be super proud of!
