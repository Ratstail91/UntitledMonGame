Authentication as Middleware (and other fun things)
---

_13 June 2020_

Today, I had an evening stream rather than a morning one - mostly because I felt like crap this morning.

But I did manage to fix quite a few bugs today, as well as expanding on the invisible work listed on my [TODO list](https://github.com/Ratstail91/EggTrainer/projects/1).

One major problem I fixed off-stream was a timeout error in the move selection screen - this was due to me updating the public API without realizing parts of the game do indeed use that public API. So slight embarrassment and a hotfix later, and it's working again. The CSS is still wonky on that page for some reason, so the list doesn't line up right.

In addition, I've also implemented "Authentication as Middleware", which means whenever you interact with the game (outside of logging, signing up, logging out, etc) your request is guaranteed to pass through authentication code that makes sure it really is you. This was a long time coming, but much easier than I thought it would be.

I've also made a couple other small tweaks, like putting images on the front page to catch people's attention. I'm hoping the new uncommon-level creatures will be available soon.

I'm wondering if I should continue supporting mobile play - I will for the time being, but it does mess with the CSS slightly.
