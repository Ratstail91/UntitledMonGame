Regression Time (Like Adventure Time, But Worse)
---

_27 February 2020_

So... it's been a few days since the last update - I've missed two streaming sessions, and the session on the 25th went terribly. And even worse - I've had to tear out some code that wasn't designed as well as it should've been.

The creature swapping in battles no longer works - that's what I had to tear out. It worked, but it wasn't "pending" - that is, it wasn't waiting until your opponent made their move too. This is a fundemental part of the combat system, and it needs to be coded correctly, so I've made the hard decision to rip that out and restart it.

I have 15 days left on my self-imposed time limit to get this game to open alpha - I don't know if I'll reach it at this stage, but I'll keep going. On the bright side, there are now some shiny new artworks for the creatures! I just realized I can add them in now that I'm pushing an "update" anyway.

I really appreciate everyone who has been with me this long, and are sticking with me even through the hard times. I know I can pull this off!
