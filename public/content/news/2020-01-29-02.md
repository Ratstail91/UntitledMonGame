Quick Update Concerning Missing Eggs
---

_29 January 2020_

A bug involving missing eggs has been reported, and resolved.

The cause was as follows:

0. Profiles are created on login if they don't already exist
1. Some people logged in before this was added
2. Some people remained logged in after they were added, thus lacked a profile
3. They purchased eggs without a profile, thus the egg was lost

I've credited everyone who seems to have been affected (i.e. missing coins and accounts older than the first profile).

I've also wiped the logged in sessions, so people will need to re-login, forcing the creation of any missing profiles.

A big thank you to all of my alpha testers! Without your help, these very subtle bugs would slip through the cracks!
