Soft Lockpicking
---

_31 January 2020_

I've created a simple timed process that goes off once an hour called the "soft lockpicker". Since it's possible to buy and sell to the point where you don't have coins left to engage with the game, I've made it so that if your total net worth drops below 500, it'll be reset to 500.

Hopefully I've written this in a way that can't be exploited, but like anything, it could have flaws. Remember alpha testers, send bug reports to my email listed on the front page.

This was tricky, but fun.
