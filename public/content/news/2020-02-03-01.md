Yep, One Of Those Days...

_3 February 2020_

So today, I'm having a bad morning, so I just wanted to get some small things working, rather than major changes.

I've added descriptions for creatures, items and moves, and I've exposed all of the JSON data to the API.

For those who know how, or those who want to find out how, you can use a tool called cURL or access these URLs in your browser:

	https://eggtrainer.com/api/creatures
	https://eggtrainer.com/api/items
	https://eggtrainer.com/api/moves
	https://eggtrainer.com/api/elements

You can also pass an argument (denoted by `<arg>`) to each one, and it will return only the specified creature/item/move/element:

	https://eggtrainer.com/api/creatures?creature=<arg>
	https://eggtrainer.com/api/items?item=<arg>
	https://eggtrainer.com/api/moves?move=<arg>
	https://eggtrainer.com/api/elements?element=<arg>

This reveals the internal JSON data that the game uses for various gameplay... things (premium and regular items are combined). You'll be able to track what each component of the game does, and maybe even develop your own apps if you're so inclined.

The main purpose of `/api` is for the game to use, but these particular routes are now documented for everyone.

Be aware that the name of an item and it's index in the API may not match i.e. the "Golden Apple" has an index "goldenapple", all lowercase without a space, and that things may change at any time.

Overall, I just wanted to make this easier to access, so people didn't have to dig through my github repo for them.

P.S. at the current time, you can also access the images of various things from here (premiums are for premium items, denoted in the JSON blob):
