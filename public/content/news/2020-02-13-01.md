Battle Box Bug
---

_13 February 2020_

Everything has teething problems.

In this case, it was possible for creatures in battleboxes to be inserted in the same slot, and disappear. I've fixed it, and had to remove every creature from the battleboxes. No creatures were deleted in the process.

The battle have had a large number of bugs related to them relative to the rest of the game, so I'm going over them with a fine toothed comb right now.
