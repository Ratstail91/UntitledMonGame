Hatching A Plan
---

_2 February 2020_

[I've written a lengthy plan for the game.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PBBG/comments/ex4dlj/egg_trainer_hatching_a_plan/) I'm hoping to fufill everything written there. Go and check it out, and let me know what you think in the discord, or on reddit.

In the meantime, incubation is working! You can now spend about 10 minutes hatching each creature. There's only a few creatures at the moment, but you finally get to see them! Or at least, my crappy rendering of them.

This is a big step forward, since you now have actual creatures that you can see!
