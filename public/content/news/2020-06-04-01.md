Sprint Two, Day One
---

_4 June 2020_

Hello everyone! So today, I've started the second "sprint" on Egg Trainer. I know it's been a while since the last time I worked on this, so I should probably explain why.

I never intended to work on this game constantly from start to finish, especially as hard as I was at the beginning of the year. Instead, I planned on stopping and starting the game over time, building it up as I go. It's been much, much longer than I expected between the first sprint and the second, but hopefully future gaps will be much smaller.

I can't help when I feel like developing this game and when I don't - I need to pace myself, otherwise this project crash and burn. There's actually a common term in the gaming industry called "crunch" which refers to people pushing themselves too hard to get a game out the door. I don't want to crunch on myself, so that's the situration I'm in.

As for today's development - I've updated a lot of the underlying libraries to their latest versions - what this means is that there's fewer chances of security and stability issues from other people's code. I've also tweaked and fixed a couple of timed routines, which needed fixing after the update.

The game is officially still in alpha, so if you want to sign up and log in, you'll need to contact me at krgamestudios@gmail.com, where I'll be happy to enable your alpha account (or give you a link you can use to sign up).

I'm also going to be streaming and recording the development, so you can follow me on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/Ratstail91) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbPSa933lj2D-Oa-7pPvZFw). That's a brand new YouTube channel, so I'll figure out how all that works later.

Also, just because I can, let me plug [Potion School](https://www.drivethrucards.com/product/305213/Potion-School) which I made, and is actually really good, if I do say so myself.

Thanks for sticking with me so far.
