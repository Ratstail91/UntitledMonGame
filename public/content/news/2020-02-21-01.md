Visibility is Everything

_21 February 2020_

Hello world! I'm sorry that I've been so sick lately, but I'm hoping to get this game to it's MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage as soon as possible. Today, I've made your creatures and their movesets visible in the battles! Only the two first creatures though - the battles aren't actually functional yet.

It's slow progress, but progress nonetheless.

In the mean time, I'd like to know your opinions on the game - what would you like to see in the future?

* Ladders?
* Leagues?
* New Creatures?
* New Mechanics?
* Cosmetics?
* Anything Else?

To let me know, you can contact me at the email address above, or join my discord server and let me know in person. Either way, I'm super happy to hear what you have to say!
