Public Face
---

_7 June 2020_

Today, I had a longer than usual stream, where I fixed the development database, and reworked the code behind the public-facing API. You'll be able to query the public API more easily now. This code isn't used by the game, it's just there for code-savvy users to play with, and will automatically update if I ever tweak an internal value for the creatures or items.

As an example, you can use this to get a dump of all creature data:

```
curl https://eggtrainer.com/api/creatures
```

But if you want only sepcific creatures, then you specify that creature's "idx":

```
curl https://eggtrainer.com/api/creatures?creature=spitty
```

You can use commas to separate multiple entries' idx.

The idx of each "thing" won't ever change, even if the names do - it's their internal representation.

A full breakdown of the public (and soon private) API should be available [here](https://github.com/Ratstail91/EggTrainer/blob/master/docs/api_notes.md) (it's incomplete, but I'm working on documenting everything).
