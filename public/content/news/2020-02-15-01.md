Link Invites And Resignations
---

_15 February 2020_

Today, I implemented link invitations - if you select the link button on a locked battle box, it'll copy the challenge link to your clipboard, then you can paste it whereever you like!

The the recipient is logged out, then they can login, or signup if they don't have an account. Signups obviously won't be able to challenge straight away.

Also, once you're in a battle, then the battle box is unusable until the battle is over. To end a battle, click "Resign" on the battle page.

This is getting exciting!
