Vulnerability Report

_19 February 2020_

<h1 style="color:red"><strong>A vulnerability was found by an outside party and reported.</strong></h1>

The number of user accounts and profiles, as well as the number of active accounts and profiles was available to anyone who logged in and accessed the address https://eggtrainer.com/admin

This resulted from a quirk in how JavaScript promises and Node's require function work.

No sensitive information other than what has been reported above has leaked.

Recommended change: implementing validation as express middleware instead of from inside every route.

I've been delaying the above change, and I take full responsibility for the leak in data.
