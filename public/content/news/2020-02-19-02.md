Vulnerability Disclosure
---

_19 February 2020_

<h1 style="color:red"><strong>A vulnerability was found by an outside party and reported.</strong></h1>

The data from the daily snapshot analytics tool (the number of user accounts and profiles, as well as the number of active accounts and profiles at midnight server time each day) was available to anyone who accessed the api endpoint '/api/admin'.

This resulted from a quirk in how JavaScript promises and Node's require function work.

No sensitive information other than what has been reported above has leaked.

Recommended change: implementing validation as express middleware instead of from inside every route.

I've been delaying the above change, and I take full responsibility for the leak in data.
