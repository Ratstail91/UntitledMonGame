Today I coded the visual display for the battle system. It's not functional yet (except for the resign button), but you can see it if you enter a battle.

The idea is that both you and your opponent will have two creatures out in battle - so that's why there's some duplicated elements. The first two creatures in your battle box will be the first into battle.

The button to the far left returns the creature to your battle box, at which point you'll be able to send out another - but doing so will take that creature's turn. Next to that is your creature's portrait and name, next to that are the moves your creature has equipped, with their HP and status effects above it. Next is a dropdown you can use to access items to use on your top or bottom creature respectfully. Next is a log of what has happened in the battle so far, with the resign button underneath. Finally, there's your opponents creature portraits at the far right.

On mobile, the battles will be oriented vertically, but will generally keep that same order.
