### Your Profiles

_25 January 2020_

Today, I got your profile page working! You can see the link above.

This was a lot more work than I expected, mostly because I had to make room for other stuff in th database too.

You'll notice that you have a number of coins available. These will be used to buy and sell eggs on the market place, either with NPCs, or other players. I might also add the ability to buy these coins with real money, but this will simply make things faster for you - you won't ever gain a competitive advantage with real money in this game.

I've also started working on a typechart and data structures for the creatures.

Right now, I'm exhausted. Time for a nap.
