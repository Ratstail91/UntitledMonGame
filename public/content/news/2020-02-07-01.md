Move Over!
---

_7 February 2020_

Over the last two days I've implemented creature moves! From the creature's action menu, choose "Select Moves" and you'll be taken to a move select screen. From here, you can buy moves for each creature (usually for 10 coins each) and equip them for free. Any move that a creature knows can be equipped, however there is a maximum of 4 moves equippable at any time.

You should know that some moves currently have no effect - I'm planning to add status effects to these moves - somehow.

This was a big update, and I was coding yesterday with no sleep - so if there are any bugs, please remember to report them as soon as you find them.
