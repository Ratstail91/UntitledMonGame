_30 January 2020_

I've implemented the item system today, mostly by cloning the egg system. You can buy and sell items from the shop.

You'll notice that you can't sell your last incubator, or buy more than 2. This is intentional, for game balance; I don't want some people getting too far ahead of others.

I'll have to manually give everyone an incubator after I post this.

Also, I couldn't think of a good drawing for the incubators, so Kyubey it is.
