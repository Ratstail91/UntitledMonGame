Beginning Battle Boxes!
---

_8 February 2020_

No visible updates today, sorry!

However, I've begun working on the "Battle Boxes" - these will be filled with creatures and taken into battles. You can't see them yet, but the browser console will print out an empty array - this is the structure that is filled from the database, there's just no way to actually fill that structure.

I'm wondering if I should keep working on gameplay-focused stuff off-stream, or just behind the scenes stuff. Either way, I still need to sleep in the afternoons :)
