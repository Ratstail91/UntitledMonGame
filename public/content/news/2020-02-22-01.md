Not Much Today
---

_22 February 2020_

Today, I wasted an hour trying to fix a fade effect. Damn it.

Then, I did some backend work - You can now see the creature's HP properly, and I set up the "stages" system so that you can apply buffs and debuffs eventually.

There's a lot of non-essential things that I want to get done with this game, one of which is moving the news section to a separate blog system, rather than having markdown files being fetched and rendered. It's like knowing you need to wash the dishes, but you don't have the time because you're mowing the lawn.
