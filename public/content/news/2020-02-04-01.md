Breeding Breakdown
---

_4 February 2020_

So I've exhausted my mind coding this, and my body by going for a walk - all before 9am. Let's try to make this brief.

To breed two creatures, you need to select the "breed" option from their action menu. You can only have two creatures earmarked for breeding at a time (otherwise the SQL would be so much more complex...)

Once every 12 hours, breeding occurs, and a new egg is created. Egg creation occurs in three steps:

1. Maximum rarity is determined.

The resulting egg will never be rarer than the minimum rarity of the parents - so if you breed a common and a rare, the resulting egg will be common.

The rarities are: common, uncommon, rare and mythic. Only common creatures exist at the time of writing.

2. The species is determined.

If both parents are the same species, then the egg will be that species. If instead they're the same element, then the egg will have a species of that eleement in it. Otherwise, the species is random.

On top of this, there's a 5% chance the species will mutate into something random anyway.

3. The genes are determined.

Each creature has 4 genes: health, speed, strength and power. The egg is given a random one from parent A, a random one from parent B, a random one from either of the two, and the last is generated randomly.

That's about it for breeding - and I'm glad it's over, because that code was intense.
