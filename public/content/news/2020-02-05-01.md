Inspection Time!

_5 February 2020_

Today I've given the magnifying glass a use!

While you own a magnifying glass, you'll be able to "inspect" your creatures. This will reveal all of their stats, including:

* Species stats
* Genetic stats
* Training Stats

This will allow you to more accurately decide which of your creatures are worth breeding and battling with!
