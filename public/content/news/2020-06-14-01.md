The MONSTER

_14 June 2020_

This is part of the breeding code:

```
SELECT * FROM
	(SELECT id AS idA, species AS speciesA, profileId AS profileIdA, geneticPointsHealth AS healthA, geneticPointsSpeed AS speedA, geneticPointsStrength AS strengthA, geneticPointsPower AS powerA FROM creatures WHERE breeding = TRUE ORDER BY id ASC) AS a
JOIN
	(SELECT id AS idB, species AS speciesB, profileId AS profileIdB, geneticPointsHealth AS healthB, geneticPointsSpeed AS speedB, geneticPointsStrength AS strengthB, geneticPointsPower AS powerB FROM creatures WHERE breeding = TRUE ORDER BY id DESC) AS b
ON
	a.profileIdA = b.profileIdB
WHERE
	a.idA <> b.idB
;
```

Can you blame me for noping out of this after an hour?

I'm going to need to rewrite the entire breeding system to make it easier to maintain. This is gonna be.., well, it won't be plesant. For now, I need a break.
