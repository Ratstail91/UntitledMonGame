PayPal Intergration And Financial Support
---

_1 February 2020_

Welp, I've done it, although it's still considered "experiemental". I've added PayPal intergration to my game.

I'm still experimenting with this, and it may take some troubleshooting before it gets my own green light, but hopefully it works in a live environment.

If you have any problems, you can always lodge a complaint with PayPal and request a refund; I won't begrudge you that at this point.

If I get too many refunds, I'll take this system offline in order to make it more robust.
