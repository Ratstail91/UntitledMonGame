ESLint and Invisible Work
---

_11 June 2020_

Today, I added a linter to the project, to ensure code quality is up to scratch, ragardless of who works on the code.

What this means is that I'll be able to bring on help more consistently, and hopefully will be able to accelerate development of this game as a whole.

"Invisible work" - or work which is necessary but not strictly visible to the end user - is never fun. I want nothing more than to get the battles working, even with incomplete or erroneous stats. But all of this is necessary to support a larger project, which this has now become.

I'm telling that to myself more than anyone else. I really appreciate you sticking with me throughout development.

If you feel like you want to contribute to the game, the code and assets are open source here:

Now that the linter is in place, and a lot of small issues have been worked out, I feel more confident sharing the code and asking for help.
