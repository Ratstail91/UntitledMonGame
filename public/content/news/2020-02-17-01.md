Still Sick, But Persevering
---

_17 February 2020_

So today, I did some back-end refactoring, and added a "Cancel Training" option. I don't have much time to sit and work today, so that's about all I can do right now. The refactoring should make the code easier to manage in the long run, and is already making things clearer.

Still sick, which is always fun.

I'm seriously thinking about separating the news component of the site into a microservice that I can update separate from the main repo. It has it's benefits and drawbacks, but we'll see if I get around to it. It won't be done on stream, since I consider it to be back-end work.
