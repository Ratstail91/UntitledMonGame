_11 February 2020_

Oh boy, this update is a really friggin' large one. I've spent days trying to get this to work, but ultimately I had to throw away a chunk of optimisation code, and just rely on sending the whole list of boxes at once. Hopefully, this won't be a major issue down the line.

I've added battle boxes!

These are premium items (you can't sell them, and you can only buy them with real money), however they will enable battles with other poeple. Don't worry, everyone gets one for free.

Although there's very little styling on the boxes at the moment, you'll be able to lock them manually, and use locked boxes for battle.

My rationality for making them premium is that the battle system is ultimately a mid to late game feature, and only people who have more than one team's worth of battle-ready creatures would need to have more than one battle going at a time. The price might be a tad steep, but I can revise this downwards if necessary.

That should be the last premium item for a while.

On the whole, I can sum this update up as "inefficient".
