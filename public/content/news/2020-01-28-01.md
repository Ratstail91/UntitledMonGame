Spaghetti Code
---

_28 January 2020_

Are you familiar with the term "spaghetti code"? If not, basically it's the idea that a program's code "flow" can end up jumping all over the program, essentially making it look like spaghetti. I think this program is starting to develop that problem. Luckily, it should be easy to refactor a little bit before it gets away from me. As a bonus, with clean code comes new features, fast.

Next session, maybe.

Today I've implemented buying and selling of eggs using coins. The eggs are listed at 200 coins each, but they will only sell for *half* their value, rounded down. Just keep this in mind, as it's currently possible to waste your coins entirely, essentially soft-locking yourself. I'll eventually add a feature to prevent this.

Also, I've added lots of different eggs - every elemental type has a common egg, except dragon (there are no common dragons!)

It's possible that I may need to do a server reset due to massive restructuring of the database and code at some point, but I'm trying to prevent that as well. Right - time for more sleep...
